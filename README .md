## My process
1. The first div(class = "parent") covers the whole page. I used it to center the whole    component using flexbox properties.
2. The second div(class = "container") contains the whole component and is in the center of parent div;
3. Inside the container div I have 2 more divs(class = "qr","text"). "Qr" div contains the qr image and the "text" div contains the latter text part.
4. Container div is a flexbox too, I've changed it's main axis to vertical. And aligned the items vertically.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learned about :- 
- Main concepts of flexbox.
- vh,vw
- Getting a div to the center of a page.
